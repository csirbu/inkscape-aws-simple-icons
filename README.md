# inkscape-aws-simple-icons
aws simple icons for inkscape using inkscape symbols

# quick start

```
git clone git@github.com:jbruce12000/inkscape-aws-simple-icons.git
cd ./inkscape-aws-simple-icons
./install-symbols
```

Start inkscape and select Object->Symbols and view the AWS symbol sets in the drop down.  Drag and drop to your doc as needed.  If you need to edit a symbol in your document, select the symbol, edit->clone->unlink clone.

Each icon was sized to a width of 1/2 inch.  Only SVG icons are used.  I am saving each icon set as I need them.

For group outlines, you should edit->clone->unlink clone and delete the big letters at the center.  Also you should turn off stroke scaling so the outlines stay 2px wide when you change the size of the group to wrap your content.
