aws simple icons for inkscape using inkscape symbols

# quick start

```
git clone git@github.com:jbruce12000/inkscape-aws-simple-icons.git
cd ./inkscape-aws-simple-icons

```

Start inkscape and select Object->Symbols and view the AWS symbol sets in the drop down.  Drag and drop to your doc as needed.  If you need to edit a symbol in your document, select the symbol, edit->clone->unlink clone.

Each icon was sized to a width of 1/2 inch.  Only SVG icons are used.  I am saving each icon set as I need them.
